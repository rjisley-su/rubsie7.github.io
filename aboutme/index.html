        		<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>I’m currently a senior at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Management & Technology, and a Master of Science in Applied Data Science. Upon receiving my Bachelor’s degree in May 2021, I plan to finish my Master’s degree online in one year, while working full time. I am seeking a role working somewhere in the intersection of technology and the human experience.</p>
			<p>I am a coffee lover, frequent movie-goer, and podcast aficionado. In my free time i’m reading, singing on long walks, or journaling positive affirmations. I’m passionate about living sustainably and avoiding fast fashion, smart cities, learning new things, and fostering creativity in my everyday life. I am driven by the desire to strike a balance in the intersection of human behavior, and information technology, and data. I am currently working on my senior capstone on the need for ethics in AI, to avoid algorithmic bias.</p>
